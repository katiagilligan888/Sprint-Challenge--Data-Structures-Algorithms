1a. O(n)
1b. O(n^4)
1c. O(n)

2. I would implement a binary search. First I would start at the middle floor of the building. Let's say there are 100 floors. I would throw an egg from the 50th floor. If it breaks I would go to the 25th floor. If it doesn't I would try the 75th floor. I would keep cutting the distance in half until I find the highest floor where it doesnt break. This would take O(log(n)) runtime which is a lot shorter in length than a standard search.
